# t_empty

Nothing at all: no accounts, rules, rates or factors.

## Purpose

The root of the template hierarchy, and a starting point for a scenario built from nothing. It sets only a start and end date and a seed, so every template loads on its own. Those are fallbacks: any data repo scenario in the lineage that sets its own wins, even when a template is mixed in after it. So whether a scenario has `t_empty` in its lineage or not changes nothing.

A template scenario: data repos read it from the analysis code repository's `templates/scenarios/` unless they have a scenario of the same name, which replaces it whole. See [Template scenarios](../../../docs/guides/historical-calibration.md#template-scenarios) in the historical calibration guide.

## The templates

- **`t_empty`** (this one): nothing; the root
  - [`t_inflation_factors`](../t_inflation_factors/README.md): inflation's latent factors
    - [`t_inflation_series`](../t_inflation_series/README.md): long-run inflation rates
      - [`t_inflation_ensemble`](../t_inflation_ensemble/README.md): year-by-year inflation paths
        - [`t_inflation_current`](../t_inflation_current/README.md): today's inflation rates, held, then returning
    - [`t_market_factors`](../t_market_factors/README.md): interest-rate and stock factors
      - [`t_market_series`](../t_market_series/README.md): long-run cash, bond and stock rates
        - [`t_market_ensemble`](../t_market_ensemble/README.md): year-by-year market paths
          - [`t_market_current`](../t_market_current/README.md): today's cash yield, held, then returning

# t_market_factors

Interest-rate and stock-market latent factors, under the inflation factors.

Builds on `t_inflation_factors`.

## Purpose

`interest_rates` hangs under `core_inflation`, with cash and bonds under it, because short-term yields follow inflation over a decade. Stocks get a separate root, `market`, since their returns barely follow inflation or bonds.

A template scenario: data repos read it from the analysis code repository's `templates/scenarios/` unless they have a scenario of the same name, which replaces it whole. See [Template scenarios](../../../docs/guides/historical-calibration.md#template-scenarios) in the historical calibration guide.

## The templates

- [`t_empty`](../t_empty/README.md): nothing; the root
  - [`t_inflation_factors`](../t_inflation_factors/README.md): inflation's latent factors
    - [`t_inflation_series`](../t_inflation_series/README.md): long-run inflation rates
      - [`t_inflation_ensemble`](../t_inflation_ensemble/README.md): year-by-year inflation paths
        - [`t_inflation_current`](../t_inflation_current/README.md): today's inflation rates, held, then returning
    - **`t_market_factors`** (this one): interest-rate and stock factors
      - [`t_market_series`](../t_market_series/README.md): long-run cash, bond and stock rates
        - [`t_market_ensemble`](../t_market_ensemble/README.md): year-by-year market paths
          - [`t_market_current`](../t_market_current/README.md): today's cash yield, held, then returning
